# TarraschToyEngine

A simple UCI chess engine to demonstrate the Tarrasch Chess GUI and the thc C++ chess library.

An exercise is underway to get all my Github chess projects properly aligned. When complete

- thc, a C++ implementation of the rules of chess
- Tarrasch Chess GUI, My main project, a chess workbench
- Sargon 1978, porting the original classic Z80 program to work as a UCI engine
- Tarrasch Toy Engine, a simple original UCI engine

The idea is that project thc will deliver a simple pair of C++ file thc.cpp and thc.h which
implement the rules of chess for the other three projects. When complete thc.cpp and thc.h
will be the same in all three projects! Not there yet.
