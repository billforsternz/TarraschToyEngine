# Tarrasch Toy Engine

A simple UCI chess engine to demonstrate the Tarrasch Chess GUI and the thc C++ chess library.

Future intention is to change over to the UCI wrapper for the Sargon retro engine, which
is portable C++ (doesn't use Windows specific threading and timing). Ironically the starting
point for the Sargon retro engine's wrapper was the Tarrasch Toy engines's UCI wrapper.
